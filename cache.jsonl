I called lately to inquire respecting the death of Mrs. Gore, the wife of a labourer, from cholera, at New Leigham Road, Streatham.

The abstract provides evidence that cholera is spread through human contact and travel, and that it can be spread by individual cases of the disease.

This example supports the claim that cholera can be spread through contact with an infected person.\"}"
